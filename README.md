# Bevy Basics Remastered

Welcome to **Bevy Basics Remastered** â€”

Whether you're getting your first taste of [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) or refreshing your knowledge with the latest engine updates, it's important to know the basics;

This repository is a reference and learning aid for anyone interested in the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. All examples are written in Rust and compatible with the version of Bevy used in each episode.

The hope is that you can easily find the code shown in the video and open it in your IDE of choice.
This has the benefits:
 1. The language server
    - Better syntax highlighting
    - F12 to see source
    - Can modify and see the difference
    - {&} pair colours and highlights
  2. Can modify the layout to suit your taste
     - can use your own theme
     - There is only so much space on the screen
     - Font is really large, so it can easily be read
     - You can change the font and use ligatures (I can't get motioncanvas to work with them ðŸ¥²)
     - Sometimes I need to format things to fit into the frame
     - You are more used to it

# ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Series

Explore the series to learn Bevy from concepts:

ðŸ“º [Bevy Basics Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_REMATERED_PLAYLIST_LINK_HERE)
Updated to bevy 0.16, and hopefully animated

First pass at ideas, they start very far back with Bevy 0.6 but cover concepts as well as implementation and use, while the code may be outdated, most of the core concepts are still relevant
I will still release new episodes, but they will not be animated and will aim to be quicker to produce and get ideas out for people to potentially correct for the remastered version

# ðŸ“‚ Project Files
You can find:
 - Scripts and/or talking points for each video
 - Code shown in the video
 - MotionCanvis Projects (when I work out the best way to do that)

Happy coding, and enjoy learning the basics of Bevy ðŸš€ðŸ¦€
